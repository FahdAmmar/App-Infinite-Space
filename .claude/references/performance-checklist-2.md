# Performance Checklist (continued)

## Caching Strategies

The decision material (which layer, which invalidation strategy, what never to cache) lives in the `performance-optimization` skill. This section covers the read/write patterns and the checklist.

### Read and write patterns

| Pattern | How it works | Use when | Watch out for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cache-aside** (lazy) | App checks cache, on miss reads origin and populates | Default choice; read-heavy, tolerant of a cold first hit | Every miss hits the origin, so it needs stampede protection |
| **Read-through** | Cache layer itself loads on miss | You want the load path in one place, not at every call site | Hides origin latency; a slow origin looks like a slow cache |
| **Write-through** | Write goes to cache and origin together, synchronously | Reads must never see a stale value after a write | Adds cache latency to every write |
| **Write-behind** (write-back) | Write hits cache, origin updated asynchronously | Write-heavy, and the origin is the bottleneck | Data loss window if the cache dies before the flush. Needs durability you can defend |

### Negative caching

Cache the *absence* of a result too. A key that misses on every lookup (a nonexistent user ID probed in a loop, a 404 asset) sends every request to the origin, which is a cache that only protects the happy path.

- Store an explicit "not found" sentinel with a **shorter** TTL than positive entries
- Keep the negative TTL short enough that a newly created record appears promptly
- Never let an origin *error* become a negative cache entry, or one failing minute becomes many

### Request coalescing (stampede protection)

One recompute, N waiters. Prevents a hot key's expiry from delivering the full concurrent load to the origin:

```typescript
const inFlight = new Map<string, Promise<unknown>>();

function loadOnce<T>(key: string, fetcher: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  const existing = inFlight.get(key) as Promise<T> | undefined;
  if (existing) return existing;
  const p = fetcher().finally(() => inFlight.delete(key));
  inFlight.set(key, p);
  return p;
}
```

For a shared cache, the same idea needs a distributed lock, or `stale-while-revalidate` so waiters serve the stale value instead of blocking.

### Cache checklist
- [ ] The cached call was measured as expensive first (caching a fast call adds a hop and buys nothing)
- [ ] Read/write ratio justifies the cache (re-read far more often than written)
- [ ] Cache key includes every input the response varies on: tenant, viewer, locale, permissions, feature flags
- [ ] No per-user data cached under a key that does not identify the user
- [ ] One invalidation strategy chosen (TTL, event/tag, or versioned keys), not an accidental mix
- [ ] Acceptable staleness window written down, not implied by whatever TTL was typed
- [ ] Stampede protection on hot keys (coalescing, lock, or `stale-while-revalidate`)
- [ ] Negative results cached with a shorter TTL; origin errors never cached
- [ ] Eviction policy and memory ceiling set (an unbounded cache is a memory leak)
- [ ] Hit rate monitored — a cache nobody measures is an assumption, and a low hit rate is pure overhead
- [ ] Nothing cached whose staleness is a correctness bug (balances, permissions, inventory at checkout)

## Measurement Commands

### INP field data and DevTools workflow

1. **Field data first** — check [CrUX Vis](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/vis) or your RUM tool for real-user INP before optimising
2. **Identify slow interactions** — open DevTools → Performance panel → record while interacting; look for long tasks triggered by clicks/keystrokes
3. **Test on mid-range Android** — INP issues often only surface on slower hardware; use a real device or DevTools CPU throttling (4×–6× slowdown)

```bash
# Lighthouse CLI
npx lighthouse https://localhost:3000 --output json --output-path ./report.json

# Bundle analysis
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer stats.json
# or for Vite:
npx vite-bundle-visualizer

# Check bundle size
npx bundlesize
```

```javascript
// Web Vitals in code
import { onLCP, onINP, onCLS } from 'web-vitals';
onLCP(console.log);
onINP(console.log);
onCLS(console.log);

// INP with interaction-level detail (attribution build)
import { onINP } from 'web-vitals/attribution';
onINP(({ value, attribution }) => {
  const { interactionTarget, inputDelay, processingDuration, presentationDelay } = attribution;
  console.log({ value, interactionTarget, inputDelay, processingDuration, presentationDelay });
});
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| N+1 queries | Linear DB load growth | Use joins, includes, or batch loading |
| Unbounded queries | Memory exhaustion, timeouts | Always paginate, add LIMIT |
| Missing indexes | Slow reads as data grows | Add indexes for filtered/sorted columns |
| Indexing without reading the plan | Write cost paid, read gain unproven | `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before and after; revert if the plan is unchanged |
| Redundant / unused indexes | Every write pays for them | Audit usage stats, drop what nothing reads |
| Connection pool per request | Exhausts `max_connections` under load | One pool per process; proxy for serverless |
| Cache key missing the viewer | One user's data served to another | Key on tenant, viewer, locale, permissions |
| Unbounded cache | Memory leak wearing an optimization's clothing | Set eviction policy and a memory ceiling |
| Cache stampede on a hot key | Origin takes full concurrent load at expiry | Coalesce misses, or `stale-while-revalidate` |
| Layout thrashing | Jank, dropped frames | Batch DOM reads, then batch writes |
| Unoptimized images | Slow LCP, wasted bandwidth | Use WebP, responsive sizes, lazy load |
| Large bundles | Slow Time to Interactive | Code split, tree shake, audit deps |
| Blocking main thread | Poor INP, unresponsive UI | Chunk long tasks with `scheduler.yield()` / `yieldToMain`, offload to Web Workers |
| Memory leaks | Growing memory, eventual crash | Clean up listeners, intervals, refs |
