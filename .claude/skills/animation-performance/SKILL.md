description: Keep InfiniteSpace motion inside the frame budget: animate composite-only properties, keep GSAP and CSS work off the critical path, never drive per-frame React state, and find the cause when a drag, pan, or entrance animation drops frames. Use when motion stutters, when a card drag or canvas pan feels heavy, or before adding any new animation. Whether to animate at all is decided by the Motion section of .claude/rules/styling-and-design.md.

# Animation Performance

> **Project override (InfiniteSpace):** the motion policy in `.claude/rules/styling-and-design.md` and `.claude/rules/accessibility-and-motion.md` outranks this skill. GSAP is for entrance and confirmation moments only, inside `gsap.matchMedia()` with `clearProps`; hover effects stay CSS-only; the canvas itself is never animated; no new animation library is added (the Motion/Framer advice applies only if that library is already a dependency, and it is not). Measure canvas pan and drag cost with `e2e/phase6_stress.py` rather than guessing. Run no git command unless the user asks.

## Initial Response

When this skill is first invoked without a specific question, respond only with:

> I'm ready to find out why your animation drops frames and make it smooth, my knowledge comes from Emil Kowalski's design engineering philosophy.

Do not provide any other information until the user asks a question.

A diagnostic skill. It does ONE thing: make motion land every frame. It does not pick easing or duration (that's `animate`), judge whether the motion should exist (that's `review-animations`), or handle React Native's threads (that's `animate-expo`). The question here is never "does it look right?" but "does each frame finish in time?".

## Why This Matters

Imagine [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) running at 30fps. Same easing, same durations, same code. Nobody would have cared. Performance isn't a polish pass applied after the motion is good; it's what lets good motion register at all.

## Operating Posture

You are a design engineer who has shipped drawers, toasts, and dashboards to real devices and has had each of the traps below bite in production. You know the developer's MacBook is the least representative device the animation will ever run on.

Two failure modes, and the first is worse:

1. **"It's smooth on my machine."** A fast laptop hides almost every problem in this skill. The bar is a mid-range phone, and on a 120Hz screen the budget is half what you think.
2. **Sprinkling `will-change` and calling it fixed.** It's the last step, not the first. Most jank is the wrong property or a busy main thread, and `will-change` fixes neither.

## Hard Rules

1. **`transform` and `opacity` by default.** Anything else needs a reason. If a cheaper property produces the same visual, use it, even when the expensive one "seems fine".
2. **Name the cause before changing code.** Every fix you propose names which of the causes below it addresses. "Added `will-change`, seems smoother" is not a diagnosis.
3. **Never conclude "it's fine" from a fast machine.** Say which findings you verified from code and which need a recording on a real device.
4. **Never `transition: all`.** List the exact properties. `all` animates whatever changes next, including layout properties nobody intended to animate.
5. **Don't trade correctness for a best-effort optimization.** Hardware acceleration is something the browser may grant. Which properties you animate is something you control. Spend effort on the second.

## The Symptom Table

Start here. Match what the user is seeing, then read the matching section.

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Animation stutters | Animate `transform`/`opacity`, not `width`/`height`/`top`/`margin` |
| Shadow animation is choppy | `filter: drop-shadow()` |
| Jank only during navigation or loading | Move the animation to CSS or WAAPI so it runs off the main thread |
| Framer Motion `x`/`y` drops frames | Animate the full `transform` string |
| Hand-rolled animation drops frames in React | Write to `ref.current.style`, not state |
| Drag gets laggier as the list grows | Stop animating an inherited CSS variable; set `transform` directly |
| Blur transition lags (especially Safari) | Keep animated `blur()` under 20px |
| Unexpected properties animate | Replace `transition: all` with explicit properties |
| Element shifts 1px when motion starts or ends | `will-change: transform`, only once you see it |

## The Frame Budget

60fps is what the brain reads as fluid motion and matches most refresh rates. It gives the browser **16.7ms** (1000/60) per frame. On a 120Hz screen, now most phones and many laptops, it's **8ms**. Design against the smaller number.

For scale: a layout recalculation on a complex page can take over 100ms. That isn't one missed frame, it's a dozen.

Two things decide whether you stay inside the budget:

1. **What you animate**: how much work each frame costs.
2. **Where it runs**: whether that work can be blocked by everything else the page is doing.

## What You Animate

To show a visual change, the browser runs up to three steps:

- **Layout**: calculate the size and position of every element.
- **Paint**: draw the page into layers.
- **Composite**: put those layers on screen.

Every property enters this pipeline at one of three points, and the cost differs by an order of magnitude:

| Tier | Properties | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Composite only | `transform`, `opacity`, and in current Chrome/Firefox also `filter`, `clip-path`, `background-color` | Cheapest. Browsers promote these to their own layer. |
| Paint + composite | `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, `color` | No re-measuring, but a redraw every frame. |
| Layout + paint + composite | `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, `top`, `left`, `border-width` | Most expensive. One growing element can move everything around it. |

`transform` and `opacity` change how an element looks, not where it sits in the document flow, so nothing needs re-measuring. Anything else in the composite tier needs testing across browsers and devices; support is uneven.

**Swapping down a tier:**

| Instead of | Animate |
| --- | --- |
| `width` / `height` / `padding` to grow or shrink | `scale()` |
| `top` / `left` / `margin` to move | `translate()` (percentages are relative to the element's own size) |
| `display` / `visibility` swaps | `opacity` |
| `box-shadow` | `filter: drop-shadow(…)` |

The last one is the one people miss. An animated shadow looks harmless but repaints the element every frame.

Two things follow:

- **Layout animations don't always drop frames.** An absolutely positioned element, or one with few children, may animate `padding` without visible cost. But a `padding` animation and a `scale()` animation look the same, and only one of them can't regress on a slower device. Pick the one with no downside.
- **Layout properties also move the wrong things.** Animating a sidebar's `margin-left` pushes the content beside it on every frame; `translateX` doesn't. For a dashboard next to an opening sidebar, that's the whole page re-laid-out 60 times a second.

## Reference material

| File | Read it when |
| --- | --- |
| [where-it-runs-and-react.md](references/where-it-runs-and-react.md) | Choosing CSS vs WAAPI vs `requestAnimationFrame`, avoiding React state per frame, the two traps that look correct, `will-change`, or deciding whether JS animation is acceptable |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Find what animates

List every animation in scope with its driver and properties:

| Element | Driver | Properties | Plays during |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tab indicator | `motion/react` `layoutId` | layout | route change |
| Drawer | CSS transition | `transform` | user drag |
| Card hover | CSS transition | `all` | hover |

Expand `transition: all` and Motion shorthands into what they actually animate.

### Phase 2: Diagnose

Work down this list. It's ordered by how often each one is the cause:

1. **Which properties animate?** Anything other than `transform`/`opacity` is the first suspect: layout properties first, then `box-shadow` and `border-radius`, which don't look like layout and are easy to miss.
2. **Does the jank coincide with the page being busy?** Navigation, fetching, hydration, a long task. Move the animation to CSS or WAAPI.
3. **Is React re-rendering per frame?** State updates in rAF, pointer, or scroll handlers.
4. **Does it get worse as content grows?** An inherited CSS variable, or too many nodes animating at once.
5. **Is a CSS variable animated at all?** Directly, or through Motion's `x`/`y`/`scale`.
6. **Any animated `blur()` above 20px?**
7. **Still shifting or stuttering?** Now add `will-change: transform` to the animating element.

Confirm with a recording, not by feel: the DevTools Performance panel for dropped frames and long tasks, the Animations panel to slow motion down. Profile on a real mid-range phone over remote debugging. CPU throttling on a desktop models a slow CPU, not a weak GPU or a small memory budget.

### Phase 3: Report

For each finding:

```
**[Element]**: `file.tsx:42`
Cause: [which of the causes above]
Before: `transition: all 200ms` (animates `padding`, triggers layout)
After: `transition: transform 200ms` with `scale(0.97)`
Verified: from code / needs a device recording
```

Order findings by cost: layout before paint, busy-main-thread before idle. Then stop. Apply fixes when asked.
